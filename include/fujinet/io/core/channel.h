// Readability is a state, not a notification. available() must stay true for
// as long as unread bytes remain, however they were announced, and read() must
// return bytes the platform actually holds, in arrival order, never a count
// taken from an event. POSIX gives this directly: the channels poll() for
// POLLIN, which reports current state, and read() non-blocking descriptors.
//
// A platform whose driver announces arrivals through events instead (the
// ESP-IDF UART, edge-triggered epoll, kqueue counts, Windows overlapped I/O,
// RTOS UART drivers) must not read just what each event announced. Such
// drivers drop events under load while keeping the bytes, which then sit
// unread until they surface inside a later packet. Read everything the driver
// holds; fujinet/io/uart_rx_drain.h does this for any event-driven driver.
